<blockquote><span class="bqstart">&#8220;</span>	

<p>The beet is the most intense of vegetables. The 
radish, admittedly, is more feverish, but the fire of 
the radish is a cold fire, the fire of discontent not of 
passion. Tomatoes are lusty enough, yet there runs 
through tomatoes an undercurrent of frivolity.	
beets are deadly serious.</p>
